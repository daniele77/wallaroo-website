<h1>Wallaroo Roadmap</h1>

<p>The following gives an outline of some of the features which are envisaged, post Wallaroo 0.7</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add an option to use a non-intrusive mechanism at least for the creation mechanism. </li>
<li>Check of the associations cardinality / optional associations [<strong>done in v. 0.3</strong>] </li>
<li>Loading the classes from a dynamic loaded library (.dll or .so) [<strong>done in v. 0.4</strong>] </li>
<li>(Optionally) using C++11 in the API [<strong>done in v. 0.2</strong>] </li>
</ul>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve or change the device/plug metaphor. [<strong>done in v. 0.7</strong>] </li>
<li>Remove the boost dependencies for C++0x compilers (i.e.: don&#x27;t rely on boost for XML and JSON parsing)? </li>
<li>Separate the creation mechanism from the <tt>Catalog</tt> class? </li>
<li>Consider to pass the constructor parameters in another way. Maybe with a generic set property method or with a properties bag passed in the ctor. [<strong>done in v. 0.6</strong>] </li>
<li>I definitely don&#x27;t like <tt>MultiplePlug</tt>. Above all, I don&#x27;t like <tt>MultiplePlug</tt> deriving from <tt>std::list</tt>. [<strong>solved in v. 0.2</strong>] </li>
<li>Improve (or change) the syntax of the xml loading file. [<strong>done in v. 0.3</strong>] </li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation and Samples</h2>
<ul>
<li>More documentation: tutorial page and API documentation. </li>
<li>More exhaustive samples [<strong>done in v. 0.3</strong>] </li>
</ul>
